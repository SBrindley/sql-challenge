# Module 9 Challenge Details

Background
It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

Instructions
This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

Data Modeling
Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. To create the sketch, feel free to use a tool like QuickDBD Links to an external site..

I used Quick DB and then amended further in PGAdmin. I create one table at a time and imported them in the order they were created in so the tables imported correctly. I checked as I imported each one but took this out of the final code.
